<h2>Programming Project 2</h2>
<h3>Due Friday, October 17 at 11:59pm</h3>

<p>The purpose of this project is to give you practice writing loops.  </p>

<h3>General Guidelines (20% of your grade will be based on using good style)</h3>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>All methods listed below must be <tt>public</tt> and <tt>static</tt>.</li>
<li>No additional methods are needed.  
However, you may write additional <em>private</em> helper methods, but you need to have efficient and simple algorithms. Do not write helper methods that do extra, unnecessary,
traversals of the data.</li>
<li>You should place a comment at the top of the file that contains your name
and a short description of the purpose of the class.</li>
<li>You should place a <em>short</em> comment before (directly above) each method describing the method.  The comment should
be only describe <em>what</em> the method does, not <em>how</em> it does it.  Do not simply copy the descriptions
below for your comments.</li>
<li>You are encouraged to make the comments above the class and methods in JavaDoc style, but that is not required.</li>
<li>You should place a short comment directly above each field (if you have any)
indicating the purpose of the variable.</li>
<li>You should place a short comment either above or next to each 
variable however variables that are only used as loop indeces do not 
need comments.</li>
<li>You should place a short comment above each loop explaining how the loop works.  Ideally, you should list the goal of the 
loop, any required precondition for the loop, and if you can, a good iteration subgoal for the loop.</li>
<li>Any other complicated code such as code the has lots of if statements or variables should contain <em>short</em> comments to help the reader.  The comments can either be above the code fragment or to the right, aligned in a column.</li>
<li>If your code is using a loop to modify or create a string, you need to use the <tt>StringBuilder</tt> class from the API.</li>
<li><strong>Important:</strong> While it is tempting to hunt through the API to find methods of <tt>String</tt> and <tt>StringBuilder</tt> to help you, most of the methods will be too inefficient for good code.  You should limit your code to use the
<tt>charAt</tt> and <tt>length</tt> methods of <tt>String</tt> and the
<tt>append</tt>, <tt>charAt</tt>, <tt>setCharAt</tt>, <tt>length</tt>, and <tt>toString</tt> methods of <tt>StringBuilder</tt>.  You may use methods from the <tt>Character</tt>
class though they are not required.</li>
<li><strong>Important:</strong> This homework is to give you practice manipulating strings using loops.  Do not use arrays in your program.</li>
<li><strong>Important:</strong> You should not use the commands <tt>break</tt> nor <tt>continue</tt> in your loops.</li>
<li>Remember to use good style: everything should be indented nicely, 
variables should have good names, there should be a blank line between 
each method.</li>
</ul><p></p>

<p>To submit your project, click on the <em>HW 2</em> link, and you should find a <em>Submit</em> link.  Attach your
Java file and your testing report.
Remember to attach the files that end in <tt>.java</tt>, not <tt>.class</tt> or <tt>.java~</tt>.</p>

<h3>Part I: Programming (60% of your grade will be correctness of the following)</h3>

<p>Try to keep your code as simple as possible.</p>


<p>Create a class called <tt>HW2</tt> that contains the following methods:
</p><ol>

<li><p><tt>isAlphabeticalOrder</tt> takes a <tt>String</tt> as input and returns a <tt>boolean</tt>:
The method returns <tt>true</tt> if all the letters of the input string are in alphabetical order, regardless of case.
Any character that is not a letter is ignored.
The method returns <tt>false</tt> otherwise.
</p><pre>&gt; HW2.isAlphabeticalOrder("ac!ffG5 h")
true
&gt; HW2.isAlphabeticalOrder("ac!nfG5 h")
false
</pre>
<p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>removeNchars</tt> takes a <tt>String</tt>, an <tt>int</tt> and a <tt>char</tt> and returns a <tt>String</tt>:
The output string is the same as the input string except that the first <em>n</em> occurrences of the input <tt>char</tt>
are removed from the string, where <em>n</em> represents the input integer.  If there are not <em>n</em> occurrences of the input
character, then all occurrences of the character are removed.
</p><pre>&gt; HW2.removeNchars("Hello there!", 2, 'e')
"Hllo thre!"
&gt; HW2.removeNchars("Hello there!", 10, 'e')
"Hllo thr!"
&gt; HW2.removeNchars("Hello there!", 1, 'h')
"Hello tere!"
</pre>
<p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>moveXright</tt> takes a <tt>char</tt> and a <tt>String</tt> as input and returns a <tt>String</tt>:<br>
The output string should be the same as the input strinc except that the first occurrence of the input <tt>char</tt> is swapped with the 
character immediately to its right.  If there is no occurrence of the input <tt>char</tt> or if it is the last character of the input string,
then the output will be identical to the input.
</p><pre>&gt; HW2.moveXright('X', "abcXde")
"abcdXe"
&gt; HW2.moveXright('X', "abcdeX")
"abcdeX"
</pre>
<p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>bracketString</tt> takes two <tt>String</tt>s and returns a <tt>String</tt>:<br>
The output string should be the same as the first input string except 
that every occurrence of the second input string should be placed inside
 brackets [ ].<br>
If a string exists twice as an overlap (ex: "ellelle" contains two "elle"), the first occurrence is bracketed.<br>
</p><pre>&gt; HW2.bracketString("Sheets wheels thee tree heed McPhee", "hee")
"S[hee]ts w[hee]ls t[hee] tree [hee]d McP[hee]"
&gt; HW2.bracketString("a b a b c a b a b c", "a b")
"[a b] [a b] c [a b] [a b] c"
&gt; HW2.bracketString("ellellelle", "elle")
"[elle]ll[elle]"
</pre>
<p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>moveAllXsRight</tt> takes a <tt>char</tt> and a <tt>String</tt> as input and returns a <tt>String</tt>:<br>
The output string should be the same as the input string except that 
every occurrence of the input character should be shifted one character 
to 
the right.  If it is impossible to shift a character to the right (it is
 at the end of the string), then it is not shifted.
</p><pre>HW2.moveAllXsRight('X', "abcXdeXXXfghXiXXjXX")
"abcdXefXXXghiXjXXXX"
</pre>
<p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>moveXdown</tt> takes a <tt>char</tt> and a <tt>String</tt> as input and returns a <tt>String</tt>:<br>
The output string should be the same as the input string except that the
 first occurrence of the input character should be swapped with one 
other character of the string.
The character the input character is swapped with should be after the 
next occurrence of the special <em>end-of-line</em> character <tt>'\n'</tt>,
 the same number of characters
after the end-of-line character as the first occurrence is after either 
its previous end-of-line character or the start of the string, and 
before the next end-of-line character.
If no such character exists in the string, the output should be the same
 as the input string.
</p><pre>&gt; HW2.moveXdown('X', "abcXd\nefghi\njklm")
"abchd
efgXi
jklm"
&gt; HW2.moveXdown('X', "abchd\nefgXi\njklm")
"abchd
efgmi
jklX"
&gt; HW2.moveXdown('X', "abcXd\nefg\njklm")
"abcXd
efg
jklm"
</pre>
<p></p></li>

</ol><p>

</p><h4>Extra Credit (10%)</h4>
Create the following three methods:
<ul>
<li><p><tt>moveXleft</tt> takes a <tt>char</tt> and a <tt>String</tt> and does the reverse of <tt>moveXright</tt> in that it swaps the first occurrence of the input
<tt>char</tt> with the character immediately to its left.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>moveXup</tt> takes a <tt>char</tt> and a <tt>String</tt> that does the reverse of <tt>moveXdown</tt> in that it swaps the first occurrence of the input
<tt>char</tt> with the character immediately <em>above</em> it, if such a character exists.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>fifteenPuzzle</tt> takes a <tt>char</tt> and a <tt>String</tt> and returns nothing.  The methods uses the <tt>Scanner</tt> class to read user input.
The method repeats the following until the user enters <tt>"q"</tt>.  The method  prints the input string using <tt>System.out</tt>, and it gets user input.  
The method then calls either <tt>moveXup</tt>, <tt>moveXright</tt>, <tt>moveXdown</tt> or <tt>moveXleft</tt> depending on if the user enters <tt>"u"</tt>,
<tt>"r"</tt>, <tt>"d"</tt> or "l". Each method is called with the <tt>char</tt> set to the input <tt>char</tt> of the <tt>fifteenPuzzle</tt> method
and the current string.  The string returned by the method call is the new current string.
For example, the following call to <tt>fifteenPuzzle</tt>
</p><pre>HW2.fifteenPuzzle(' ', "EC5D\n6 A3\n9B78\n2F14")
</pre>
will initially print
<pre>EC5D
6 A3
9B78
2F14
</pre>
and the goal of the game is to move the space left/right/up/down to eventually produce:
<pre>1234
5678
9ABC
DEF
</pre>
<p></p></li></ul>

<p></p>

<h3>Part 2: Project Testing (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>You need to write tests for each of the methods above.  Your tests 
should be thorough.
Your testing report should describe why your test cases sufficiently 
tested your code as well as the specific tests you ran and their 
results.
If you are unable to complete a method above, you should still
describe tests that would test the method had it been completed.</p>

<p>Hints for testing loops.  Your tests need to, at the minimum cover the following cases:
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Test 0, test 1, test many:</strong>  This means you have to test cases where the parameters, if they are integers,
are 0, 1 or some value other than 1.  If the parameters are strings, you have to test strings of length 0, 1, and more than 1.
If the strings must contain certain data, you need to test cases where they contain 0, 1, and more than 1 of the desired data.</li>
<li><strong>Test first, last, and middle:</strong>  In cases where you 
have to search in or modify a string, you need to test
cases where the item to be found or modified is the first character of 
the string, the last character of the string, or somewhere
in the middle of the string.</li>
</ol><p></p>

<p>In summary, your tests should cover each of the above cases for each of the methods you complete in the homework.
Your testing report should state what <em>test 0, test 1, test many</em> and <em>test first, last, and middle</em> mean for each of the homework
methods and how your tests covered these cases.</p>

<p><strong>JUnit</strong>: you will be learning about JUnit soon in a lab.  JUnit will be required for future homeworks, and you are welcome
to use it with this homework.  If you choose to write JUnit tests for your code,
your report should not list the specific tests and their results because the graders can run your JUnit tests.
Instead, your report should only detail what <em>test 0, test 1, test many</em> and <em>test first, last, and middle</em> means for each
method and why your JUnit tests cover those cases.
