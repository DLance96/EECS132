<h2>Programming Project 5</h2>
<h3>Due Sunday, December 7 at 11:59pm</h3>

<p><strong>As Monday, December 8 is Reading Day and needs to be spent preparing for final exams, <em>no late assignments will be accepted</em>.</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of this project is to practice using linked lists, array lists, generic types, iterators, and comparators.</p>

<p>To submit your project, click on the <em>Project 5</em> link, and you should find a <em>Submit</em> link.  Attach your
Java files and your testing report.
Remember to attach the file that end in <tt>.java</tt>, not <tt>.class</tt> or <tt>.java~</tt>.</p>

<h3>General Guidelines (20% of your grade will be based on using good style)</h3>

<p>Guidelines continued from past projects:
</p><ul>
<li>You should place a JavaDoc comment at the top of the file that contains your name (with an appropriate tag)
and a short description of the purpose of the class.</li>
<li>You should place a <em>short</em> JavaDoc comment before (directly above) each method describing the method.  The comment should
be one sentence and describe <em>what</em> the method does, not <em>how</em> it does it.  Be certain to use the
appropriate JavaDoc tags for parameters, return values, and exceptions (if appropriate). </li>
<li>You should place a short JavaDoc comment directly above any field indicating the purpose of the variable.</li>
<li>You should place a comment next to any local variable (loop indeces do not need comments) indicating the purpose
of the variable. </li>
<li>You should place a short comment above each loop explaining how the loop works.
Ideally, you should list the goal of the
loop, any required precondition for the loop, and if you can, a good invariant for the loop.</li>
<li>The class should be organized so the fields are at the top, then the constructors, then the non-static methods,
and finally the static methods.  The <tt>main</tt> method should be last.</li>
<li>There should be an empty line between the end of one method and the start of the JavaDoc comment for the next method.</li>
<li>All variables and methods should be named according to the standard Java protocol.</li>
<li>All code should be indented appropriately.</li>
<li>You need to avoid unnecessary fields in your class. </li>
<li>Your loops should be simple.  Avoid nested loops unless they are required. Use good loop conditions so that you do not need <tt>break</tt> or <tt>continue</tt> or break-like code in the body of your loops.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>


<h3>Programming (60% of the project grade)</h3>

<p>This class will implement a generic database.  This database will let
 you add and delete items, look up items, and sort by different fields. 
 The database will be not be specific
to any type of data so please note, you will need to use generic types, 
but the generic types are not specified in the instructions.  Modern 
databases use a special datatype
called a <em>B-tree</em> to store the data in a way that gives both fast
 access and relatively quick insertion and deletion.  You will learn 
about B-trees in EECS 233.  For
this project, we will use arrays (actually ArrayLists)  and linked lists
 get a similar behavior.</p>

<p>The database will store its data in a list of nodes.  You should use something like the <tt>LLNode</tt> or the <tt>DLNode</tt> types from our course.  We are using nodes so that
we can quickly insert and (relatively) quickly delete.</p>
<p>In addition, we will create <em>indexes</em> into the data.  Each of our indexes will be an <tt>ArrayList</tt> that stores the same elements as the nodes. (We are not actually
duplicating the data since only addresses are stored.)  Each index will be sorted according to some <em>trait</em>.  Then, if we want to lookup data by some <em>trait</em> and
we have an index for the <em>trait</em> available, we can use binary search instead of the slower linear search.</p>

<p>In this homework, you will use <tt>Scanner</tt>, <tt>Comparator</tt>, and <tt>ArrayList</tt> from the Java API.  For the <tt>LinkedList</tt>, you may use either the one from
the API or one that we developed in the course.  However, the linked list you use must implement <tt>Iterable</tt>.</p>

<p>Create the following classes:
</p><ul><li><p><tt>DatabaseType</tt>: an interface that contains one method
    </p><ol><li><p><tt>Comparator getComparatorByTrait(String trait)</tt> where <tt>Comparator</tt> is an interface in <tt>java.util</tt>.</p></li></ol>
   <p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>Database</tt>: a class that limits the types it can store to <tt>DatabaseType</tt>s.  The database will store the data in nodes, just like a linked list.
The database will also let the user create an <em>index</em> for the database.  An index is a sorted array (or in our case, a sorted <tt>ArrayList</tt>) of the data so that
searches can happen quickly.
The <tt>Database</tt> class should have the following fields:
</p><ol><li><p>A <em>node</em> (something like <tt>LLNode</tt> or <tt>DLNode</tt>) that indicates the start of the list of nodes that store the data in the database.</p></li>
    <li><p>A <tt>Hashtable</tt> that uses <tt>String</tt> as the key and <tt>ArrayList</tt> as the value.  The hashtable will store the different <em>index</em>es
       available to fast sort the data.</p></li></ol>
The <tt>Database</tt> should have the following methods:
<ol><li><p><tt>void add</tt> takes an <em>element</em> add adds it to the database by creating a node for the data and attaching it to the list of nodes.
    The hashtable is cleared because all indexes stored in it are no longer valid.  The <tt>add</tt> method should work very quickly, and so no traversal of the nodes is allowed.</p></li>
    <li><p><tt>void delete</tt> takes an <em>element</em> and deletes 
the element from the list of nodes.  If the element occurs more than 
once in the list, all copies should be deleted.  If anything is deleted,
 the hashtable is cleared because the indexes are
              no longer valid.  You may use linear search to find the 
element to delete.  In the extra credit, a faster binary search on an 
index is suggested.</p></li>
    <li><p><tt>LinkedList lookupInList</tt> takes a value and a <tt>Comparator</tt> and returns a <tt>LinkedList</tt> that contains all elements in the database that match the input value.  
	Do a <em>linear search</em> on the database's list of nodes, use the <tt>Comparator</tt> to identify all elements in the list of nodes that match the input value, 
        and add those values to the <tt>LinkedList</tt>.  If no such elements exists, an empty <tt>LinkedList</tt> is returned.  Note that the type of the input <em>value</em>
        will match the type of the elements in the database.</p></li>
    <li><p><tt>LinkedList lookupInIndex</tt> takes a value, an <tt>ArrayList</tt> <em>index</em>, and a <tt>Comparator</tt> and returns a <tt>LinkedList</tt> that contains
               all elements of the database that match the input value.  You may assume the <tt>ArrayList</tt> is already sorted according to the input <tt>Comparator</tt>. 
               Do a <em>binary search</em> on the <tt>ArrayList</tt> using the <tt>Comparator</tt> to find one
               element that matches the input value. (You may use either the binary search from the Java API <tt>Collections</tt> or write your own.) 
               Then, using the <tt>Comparator</tt>, find all elements in the <tt>ArrayList</tt> that matches the input value and place them
               into a <tt>LinkedList</tt>. (Remember, the <tt>ArrayList</tt> is sorted so you can do this quickly.)  
               If no such elements exist, return an empty <tt>LinkedList</tt>.  Note that the type
               of the input value will match the type stored in the database.</p></li>

    <li><p><tt>void makeIndex(String trait)</tt>:  If the database is empty, this method does nothing.  Otherwise, since the database contains only elements that are <tt>DatabaseType</tt>s,
           call the <tt>getComparatorByTrait(trait)</tt> method, using the <tt>trait</tt> to retrieve a <tt>Comparator</tt>.  Create an <tt>ArrayList</tt> and copy the addresses of the elements
           of the database into the <tt>ArrayList</tt>.  Sort the <tt>ArrayList</tt> using the <tt>Comparator</tt>, and store the <tt>ArrayList</tt> into the hashtable using the
           <tt>trait</tt> as the key.  (You may use a sort from the Java API <tt>Collections</tt>, or you may write your own, but if you do your own sort, it must be efficient.)</p></li>

    <li><p><tt>LinkedList lookup</tt> takes a <tt>String trait</tt> and a value.  If there exists an index in the hashtable that has a key that matches the input <em>trait</em>, call 
        <tt>lookupInIndex</tt> with the given value, the <tt>ArrayList</tt> index, and the appropriate <tt>Comparator</tt> for the <em>trait</em>. (You can get the <tt>Comparator</tt> by calling
        the value's <tt>getComparatorByTrait</tt> method.).  Otherwise, if there does not exist an index in the hastable for the input <em>trait</em>, call
        <tt>lookupInList</tt> with the given value and the appropriate <tt>Comparator</tt> for the <em>trait</em>. Return the <tt>LinkedList</tt> returned by these methods.
        (Note, if the database is empty, this method should return an empty <tt>LinkedList</tt>.)</p></li>

    <li><p><tt>ArrayList getList(String trait)</tt>: If an index for <em>trait</em> exists in the hashtable, return it.  Otherwise, call <tt>makeIndex</tt> with the <tt>trait</tt>
        to create the index and return that index.  (Note that if the database is empty, the method should return an empty <tt>ArrayList</tt>.)</p></li></ol><p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>Contact</tt>: a class that represents a phone/email contact.  The <tt>Contact</tt> class should implement the <tt>DatabaseType</tt> interface.
   A contact should have three <tt>String</tt>s, a <em>name</em>, a <em>phone number</em>, and a <em>e-mail</em>.  You should have the appropriate constructor as well as 
   getter and setter methods.  In addition, you should have the following methods:
   </p><ol><li><p><tt>String toString</tt> overriding the method of <tt>Object</tt></p></li>
       <li><p><tt>boolean equals</tt> overriding the method of <tt>Object</tt>.  Two contacts should be equal if all fields are equal.</p></li>
       <li><p><tt>Comparator getComparatorByTrait(String trait)</tt>: if the <tt>trait</tt> is <tt>"name"</tt>, the method should return a <tt>Comparator</tt> that compares two
             <tt>Contact</tt>s by the name field.  If the <tt>trait</tt> is <tt>"phone"</tt>, the method should return a <tt>Comparator</tt> that compares two
             <tt>Contact</tt>s by the phone number field.  If the <tt>trait</tt> is <tt>"email"</tt>, the method should return a <tt>Comparator</tt> that compares two
             <tt>Contact</tt>s by the e-mail field.  Otherwise, the method should return <tt>null</tt>.</p></li>
        </ol><p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>ContactDatabase</tt>: a <tt>ContactDatabase</tt> is a <tt>Database</tt> that stores <tt>Contact</tt>s.  The class should have the following methods:
   </p><ol><li><p><tt>printList</tt>: takes an <tt>Iterable</tt> and prints the contents of the <tt>Iterable</tt> using <tt>System.out</tt>.  Each entry should go on its own line, 
        and each line should be numbered, starting at 1.</p></li>
       <li><p><tt>main</tt>:  The main method should do the following, either inside the method or in helper methods.  It should create a <tt>ContactDatabase</tt> and a <tt>Scanner</tt>
          object that reads from <tt>Standard.in</tt>.  You should have a loop that reads use input using <tt>Scanner.next()</tt> or <tt>Scanner.nextInt()</tt>.
          The loop does the following:
     </p><ol type="a"><li>If the user enters <tt>"quit"</tt>, exit the program.</li>
                  <li>If the user enters <tt>"add"</tt>, create a new <tt>Contact</tt> with the next three strings entered by the user, and add the <tt>Contact</tt> to the database.
                      (For example, the user could type "add Harold 368-5877 hsc21" and a <tt>new Contact("Harold", "368-5877", "hsc21")</tt> is added to the database.)</li>
                  <li>If the user enters <tt>"listby"</tt>, the next input will be the <em>trait</em>. Then call the <tt>getList</tt> method with the trait (assuming it is valid),
                       and call the <tt>printList</tt> method with the returned list. (For example, the user could type <tt>"lisby name"</tt> and all the contacts in the database
                       we be listed in order of the name.)</li>
                  <li>If the user enters "find", the next two user inputs will be a <em>trait</em> and a <em>value</em>.  (For example, "find name Harold" or "find email hsc21".)
                      Create a new <tt>Contact</tt> with the given value (set the other values to <tt>null</tt>), call the <tt>lookup</tt> method with the trait and the <tt>Contact</tt>,
                      and call <tt>printList</tt> with the returned list.</li>
	          <li>If the user enters <tt>"delete"</tt>, the next input will
 be a number.  (For example "delete 2".)  Then, the element that was at 
that number in the last
                       printed list is deleted from the database.  (Note
 that you will need to remember the last list returned by either <tt>"find"</tt> or <tt>"listby"</tt>.)</li>
		  <li>If the user enters <tt>"makeindex"</tt>, the next input will be a <em>trait</em>, and the <tt>makeIndex</tt> method will be called with that trait.</li>
        </ol>
      Make certain to check for errors, either using <tt>if</tt> statements or exceptions so that program does not crash and appropriate messages can be given to the user.
      <p></p></li></ol><p></p></li></ul>

<h4>Important Programming Rules</h4>

<p>The first purpose of this project is to gain practice using linked 
lists and arrays.  Do your best to use the data structures 
appropriately.  Try to avoid
traversing through the <tt>ArrayList</tt> when a direct jump is 
possible, and try to avoid code that causes extra, unnecessary 
traversals of the linked list. (Especially if
you are using the API <tt>LinkedList</tt>, watch out for unintentional 
unnecessary traversals.  Remember, the API linked list is just like our 
linked list and must traverse
the list to get any element not at the ends.)</p>

<p>The second purpose of the class is to use generic types appropriately.</p> 
<ul>
<li>If you are not doing the extra credit, your code must not generate any warning messages when compiled.</li>
<li>If you attempting the extra credit, you will not lose points if the 
extra credit part of the code generates warning messages as long as the 
non-extra credit part does not.</li>
</ul>

<h3>JUnit Testing (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>You are to write JUnit tests for your class(es) as well as a testing report.  The testing report should describe the <em>kinds</em>
 of tests that are required
for this project.  The JUnit testing classes should have comments and 
testing method names matching the specific tests to the descriptions in 
your report.  You do not need
to JUnit test the main method or other methods that interact with the 
user.</p>

<h3>Extra Credit (10%)</h3>

<p>1. When deleting, if some index exists, use that index to do a binary search to quickly find the element to delete.</p>
<p>2. Change the homework so that you can create a <tt>FullContact</tt> class that extends <tt>Contact</tt> and includes an additional field that is the <tt>relation</tt>.
You need to extend the class and set the generic types so that you will be able to create a <tt>Database</tt> that stores only <tt>FullContact</tt>s, allow a new trait
<tt>"relation"</tt>, and you should <em>not duplicate any code</em>.</p>
