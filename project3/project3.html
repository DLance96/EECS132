<h2>Programming Project 3</h2>
<h3>Due Friday, November 7 at 11:59pm</h3>

<p>The purpose of this project is to get you to use arrays and loops in building a "real" program.</p>

<p>To submit your project, click on the <em>Project 3</em> link, and you should find a <em>Submit</em> link.  Attach your
Java file, your JUnit file, and your testing report.
Remember to attach the file that end in <tt>.java</tt>, not <tt>.class</tt> or <tt>.java~</tt>.</p>

<h3>General Guidelines (20% of your grade will be based on using good style)</h3>

<p>Guidelines continued from past projects:
</p><ul>
<li>You should place a JavaDoc comment at the top of the file that contains your name (with an appropriate tag)
and a short description of the purpose of the class.</li>
<li>You should place a <em>short</em> JavaDoc comment before (directly above) each method describing the method.  The comment should
be one sentence and describe <em>what</em> the method does, not <em>how</em> it does it.  Be certain to use the
appropriate JavaDoc tags for parameters, return values, and exceptions (if appropriate). </li>
<li>You should place a short JavaDoc comment directly above any field indicating the purpose of the variable.</li>
<li>You should place a comment next to any local variable (loop indeces do not need comments) indicating the purpose
of the variable. </li>
<li>You should place a short comment above each loop explaining how the loop works.
Ideally, you should list the goal of the
loop, any required precondition for the loop, and if you can, a good invariant for the loop.</li>
<li>The class should be organized so the fields are at the top, then the constructors, then the non-static methods,
and finally the static methods.  The <tt>main</tt> method should be last.</li>
<li>There should be an empty line between the end of one method and the start of the JavaDoc comment for the next method.</li>
<li>All variables and methods should be named according to the standard Java protocol.</li>
<li>All code should be indented appropriately.</li>
</ul><p></p>

<p>New guidelines for this project.  You must keep your code as simple as possible.  That means:
</p><ul>
<li>You need to avoid unnecessary fields in your class.  Limit fields to data that <em>must</em> be stored between moves of the game
and can not be accessed through other means.</li>
<li>Your loops should be simple.  Avoid nested loops unless they are required.  <em>Hint</em>:
 If you are running through a two dimensional
area, a nested loop is needed, but if your algorithm is running in a 
straight line through the board (even if that line is not horizontal)
only a single, unnested loop is required.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3>Programming (60% of the project grade)</h3>

<h4>Part 1: Manipulating 2-D Arrays</h4>

<p>For each of the methods below, you may assume that the two dimensional array is <em>rectangular</em>. This means that all the rows (each array in the array of arrays) have the same number of columns (elements).

</p><ol>
<li><p><tt>boolean slideLeft(int[][] array, int row)</tt>: For each non-zero element of <tt>row</tt>, starting from the leftmost non-zero element of <tt>row</tt>
 (the element at least index), you "slide" the element as far left as 
you can until it "hits" another 
non-zero element or the start of the array.
However, if the element "hits" another element with the same value, the 
two elements are "merged" by adding the sliding element's value to the 
element that it "hits".</p>
<p>For example, if the input array stores <tt>{0, 1, 0, 2}</tt>, the result of <tt>slideLeft</tt> should be <tt>{1, 2, 0, 0}</tt> as first the 1 slides left until it gets to the first index, and the 2 is then slid left until it hits the 1.<br>
If the input array stores <tt>{0, 1, 0, 1}</tt>, the result of <tt>slideLeft</tt> should be <tt>{2, 0, 0, 0}</tt>
 as the left 1 slides left until it gets to the first index, and the 
second 1 slides left until it hits the 1 causing it to merge with the 1.</p>
Since you slide the leftmost non-zero element first, if the input array stores <tt>{0, 1, 1, 1, 1}</tt>, the result of calling <tt>slideLeft</tt> should be <tt>{2, 2, 0, 0, 0}</tt><br>
and if the input array stores <tt>{0, 1, 1, 2, 0}</tt>, the result of calling <tt>slideLeft</tt> should be <tt>{4, 0, 0, 0, 0}</tt>.<p></p>
<p>The method should return <tt>true</tt> if at least one element was slid, and <tt>false</tt> if the array did not change. (See if you can do that without making an extra copy of the array.)</p></li>

<li><p><tt>boolean slideRight(int[][] array, int row)</tt>: Behaves exactly the same as <tt>slideLeft</tt> except that it starts at the rightmost non-zero element of <tt>row</tt> (the element at greatest index), and slides the element to the right.</p></li>

<li><p><tt>boolean slideUp(int[][] array, int col)</tt>: Behaves exactly the same as <tt>slideLeft</tt> except that it starts at the topmost non-zero element in <tt>col</tt> (that is, the element at <tt>array[x][col]</tt> with the smallest value <tt>x</tt>),
and slides the element up.</p></li>

<li><p><tt>boolean slideDown(int[][] array, int col)</tt>: Behaves exactly the same as <tt>slideLeft</tt> except that it starts at the bottommost non-zero element in <tt>col</tt> (that is, the element at <tt>array[x][col]</tt> with the largest value <tt>x</tt>),
and slides the element down.</p></li>

<li><p><tt>boolean slideUpLeft(int[][] array, int row, int col):</tt> Behaves the same as <tt>slideLeft</tt>
 except that the elements are slid along a diagonal.  If we imagine the 
two dimensional array as a rectangle, each non-zero element in the same 
top-left to bottom-right diagonal as the
element at <tt>array[row][col]</tt> is slid up and to the left, starting with the element closest to the (0,0) index.</p></li>

<li><p><tt>boolean slideDownRight(int[][] array, int row, int col):</tt> Behaves the same as <tt>slideLeft</tt>
 except that the elements are slid along a diagonal.  If we imagine the 
two dimensional array as a rectangle, each non-zero element in the same 
top-left to bottom-right diagonal as the 
element at <tt>array[row][col]</tt> is slid down and to the right, starting with the element furthest from the (0,0) index.</p></li>

<li><p><tt>boolean slideUpRight(int[][] array, int row, int col):</tt> Behaves the same as <tt>slideLeft</tt>
 except that the elements are slid along a diagonal.  If we imagine the 
two dimensional array as a rectangle, each non-zero element in the same 
top-right to bottom-left diagonal as the 
element at <tt>array[row][col]</tt> is slid up and to the right, starting with the element closest to the top right corner.</p></li>

<li><p><tt>boolean slideDownLeft(int[][] array, int row, int col):</tt> Behaves the same as <tt>slideLeft</tt>
 except that the elements are slid along a diagonal.  If we imagine the 
two dimensional array as a rectangle, each non-zero element in the same 
top-right to bottom-left diagonal as the 
element at <tt>array[row][col]</tt> is slid down and to the left, starting with the element closest to the bottom left corner.</p></li>
<p></p>
</ol>

<h4>Part 2: Creating a "Slide Game" GUI: Our Version of the Game 2048</h4>

The <tt>SlideGame</tt> class should have the following constructor:
<ul>
<li> <tt>public SlideGame(int rows, int column)</tt> <br>
    Creates a <tt>rows</tt>x<tt>columns</tt> grid, displays and starts the game.</li>
</ul>
You may assume that reasonable numbers are entered.<p></p>

<p>You are to create a game board by making a two dimensional grid of <tt>JButton</tt>s on a <tt>JPanel</tt>.
You do this by setting the <em>layout manager</em> of the <tt>JPanel</tt> to be a
<tt>GridLayout</tt> of the appropriate size.  Here is code that creates a layout for a 4x4 grid:
</p><pre>JPanel board = new JPanel(new GridLayout(4, 4));
</pre>
Then, the <tt>JPanel</tt> can be added as the center component of a <tt>JFrame</tt>,
<pre>  <em>your JFrame</em>.getContentPane().add(board, "Center")
</pre> 
and you can
display the <tt>JFrame.</tt><p></p>
<p>
With a 4x4 grid, you can add up to 16 components to the <tt>JPanel</tt>.
Each component added to the <tt>JPanel</tt> will go into the grid in the following order:
</p><pre> 1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8
 9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16</pre>
Where the number <em>i</em> indicates the location of the <em>i</em>th added component.
<p></p>

<p>You should create both a 2-dimensional array of <tt>int</tt>, each <tt>int</tt> initialized to 0,
and a 2-dimensional array of <tt>JButton</tt>s.  The <tt>JButtons</tt>s should be added to the <tt>JPanel</tt>
in the appropriate order so that the location of a button in the array corresponds to its location
in the panel.  Try setting a default size for the <tt>JFrame</tt> so that it launches with
a reasonable board.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> You should not call <tt>setVisible</tt> for your <tt>JFrame</tt> until after you have added all the buttons (and created any other visuals for your game).
Swing is <em>multi-threaded</em>.  We will learn about threads at the end of the course, but in short, a different thread is running your class
constructor than is displaying the JFrame.  If you run <tt>setVisible</tt> before you complete setting <tt>JFrame</tt>'s look, some of the buttons or visuals may not be visible
when the window first appears.</p>

<h4>Part 3: Initialize the Game</h4>

<p>Create methods to do the following:
</p><ol><li>Method 1: operates on the two 2-dimensional arrays.  For each element in the <tt>int</tt> array that is not zero,
it makes that number the label for the corresponding <tt>JButton</tt> in the button array.  Otherwise, the label for the
corresponding <tt>JButton</tt> should be blank.</li>
<li>Method 2: counts the number of blank <tt>JButtons</tt> (or equivalently, the number of zero elements in the <tt>int</tt> array),
uses <tt>Math.random</tt> to choose a random blank <tt>JButton</tt>, and sets both the <tt>int</tt> array element and that <tt>JButton</tt>
label to have value <tt>1</tt>.</li></ol>
<p></p>

<p>Now, use these methods so that your game displays a blank grid with a single 1 in a random square on the grid.</p>


<h4>Part 4: Implement the buttons</h4>
<p>You should create an <tt>ActionListener</tt> for the buttons.  An
<tt>ActionListener</tt> has a method <tt>actionPerformed</tt> that is called every time
the button is pressed.  The <tt>actionPerformed</tt> method has a single parameter,
<tt>ActionEvent e</tt>, and you can get the button that was pressed by using the code
</p><pre>JButton b = (JButton)e.getSource();</pre>
<tt>b</tt> is the button that was pressed, and you can locate this button in your
array of buttons to determine <tt>b</tt>'s row and column.  Alternatively, you can create separate
<tt>ActionListener</tt>s for each of your buttons.<p></p>

<p>If a button on the left column is clicked, but not one of the corner buttons, you should call <tt>slideLeft</tt> on each row of your <tt>int</tt> array.
If any elements are slid, you should call the methods to update the button labels and to add a new random 1 to the game.</p>

<p>If a button on the right column is clicked, but not one of the corner buttons, you should call <tt>slideRight</tt> on each row of your <tt>int</tt> array.
If any elements are slid, you should call the methods to update the button labels and to add a new random 1 to the game.</p>

<p>If a button on the top row is clicked, but not one of the corner buttons, you should call <tt>slideUp</tt> on each column of your <tt>int</tt> array.
If any elements are slid, you should call the methods to update the button labels and to add a new random 1 to the game.</p>

<p>If a button on the bottom row is clicked, but not one of the corner buttons, you should call <tt>slideDown</tt> on each column of your <tt>int</tt> array.
If any elements are slid, you should call the methods to update the button labels and to add a new random 1 to the game.</p>

<p>If a button in the top left corner is clicked, you should call <tt>slideUpLeft</tt> on each diagonal of your <tt>int</tt> array. 
If any elements are slid, you should call the methods to update the button labels and to add a new random 1 to the game.</p>

<p>If a button in the top right corner is clicked, you should call <tt>slideUpRight</tt> on each diagonal of your <tt>int</tt> array. 
If any elements are slid, you should call the methods to update the button labels and to add a new random 1 to the game.</p>

<p>If a button in the bottom left corner is clicked, you should call <tt>slideDownLeft</tt> on each diagonal of your <tt>int</tt> array. 
If any elements are slid, you should call the methods to update the button labels and to add a new random 1 to the game.</p>

<p>If a button in the bottom right corner is clicked, you should call <tt>slideDownRight</tt> on each diagonal of your <tt>int</tt> array. 
If any elements are slid, you should call the methods to update the button labels and to add a new random 1 to the game.</p>

<p>Clicking any other button of the grid should have no affect.</p>

<h4>Part 5: Add a <tt>main</tt> method</h4>
<p>The <tt>SlideGame</tt> class should have a <tt>main</tt> method that launches the 
game.  With a <tt>main</tt> method, you should be able to play your game by typing:
</p><pre>java SlideGame</pre>
in the Interactions pane (or outside of DrJava).  You should also allow the user to enter two arguments for the board size.
For example: <br>
<tt>java SlideGame</tt> should start a game with a 4x4 grid, and<br>
<tt>java SlideGame 4 6</tt> should start a game with 4 rows and 6 columns.
If the user enters something other than realistic numbers, your code should
do something appropriate, but not crash.<p></p>

<h3>Testing Report and JUnit (20% of the Project Grade)</h3>

<p>You will be including JUnit tests of the eight array methods in your 
project.  Your testing report should describe the following:
</p><ol><li>What "first, middle, last" and "0, 1, many" means for the 
JUnit tested methods.  Do not give the actual tests, or their results.  
The JUnit class
does that.  Rather, you need to describe why the JUnit tests you did are
 sufficient to cover all the needed cases.</li>
<li>Next describe the tests you did to verify that your game is working.
  Because the game is visual, you will not be able to provide coding 
results.
You should describe the different scenerios that need to be covered in 
testing the game, describe the tests you did in enough detail that the 
graders can perform the
same test on your game, and you should give the results of your tests.  <em>Warning</em>: your testing report must match your game.  
</li></ol><p></p>

<h3>Extra Credit: (10%)</h3>

<p>If you decide to do an extra credit, <em>you must state in the Blackboard comments what you did</em>.  Don't make us hunt
through your code.</p>

<p>For extra credit, you can make any improvements to the aesthetics or game play as you like.  <em>Exception, you may not change the behavior of the slide methods nor
change the behavior of clicking the different buttons around the grid.</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Mac machines do not, by default, permit 
you to change the color of a button.  Probably because Apple
thinks it knows better than you what a user interface should look like. 
 To be able to set a button's background color, you need to
add this code to your program (either in the constructor or the main 
method):
</p><pre>    try {
      UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getCrossPlatformLookAndFeelClassName());
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
    }
</pre>
<p></p>
