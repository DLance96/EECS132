<h2>Programming Project 4</h2>
<h3>Due Friday, November 21 at 11:59pm</h3>

<p>The purpose of this project is to create an object hierarchy and see both how an object hierarchy
can be used to greatly simplify code, and possibly to see the limitations as to what we can do with Java's classes.</p>

<p>To submit your project, click on the <em>Project 4</em> link, and you should find a <em>Submit</em> link.  Attach your
Java files and your testing report.
Remember to attach the file that end in <tt>.java</tt>, not <tt>.class</tt> or <tt>.java~</tt>.</p>

<h3>General Guidelines (20% of your grade will be based on using good style)</h3>

<p>Guidelines continued from past projects:
</p><ul>
<li>You should place a JavaDoc comment at the top of the file that contains your name (with an appropriate tag)
and a short description of the purpose of the class.</li>
<li>You should place a <em>short</em> JavaDoc comment before (directly above) each method describing the method.  The comment should
be one sentence and describe <em>what</em> the method does, not <em>how</em> it does it.  Be certain to use the
appropriate JavaDoc tags for parameters, return values, and exceptions (if appropriate). </li>
<li>You should place a short JavaDoc comment directly above any field indicating the purpose of the variable.</li>
<li>You should place a comment next to any local variable (loop indeces do not need comments) indicating the purpose
of the variable. </li>
<li>You should place a short comment above each loop explaining how the loop works.
Ideally, you should list the goal of the
loop, any required precondition for the loop, and if you can, a good invariant for the loop.</li>
<li>The class should be organized so the fields are at the top, then the constructors, then the non-static methods,
and finally the static methods.  The <tt>main</tt> method should be last.</li>
<li>There should be an empty line between the end of one method and the start of the JavaDoc comment for the next method.</li>
<li>All variables and methods should be named according to the standard Java protocol.</li>
<li>All code should be indented appropriately.</li>
<li>You need to avoid unnecessary fields in your class. </li>
<li>Your loops should be simple.  Avoid nested loops unless they are required.</li>
</ul>
and some new guidelines for this homework:
<ul>
<li>You may (and probably need to) add additional classes, interfaces, methods and fields to what is listed below.</li>
<li>You should not have an object store the same value in multiple fields. (For example, if the parent class has a field that
stores a value, the class that extends it should not have a field that stores the identical value.)</li>
<li>Your class hierarchy should be simple and intuitive.  Don't force a class to be a subclass of another if it does not make sense.</li>
<li>A good hierarchy will reduce the amount of code you need to write.</li>
</ul><p></p>

<h3>Programming (60% of the project grade)</h3>

<h4>An overview of enum</h4>

<p>The project will be using enum types.  An enum is a non-primitive 
type.  What distinguishes an enum from other non-primitive types is that
 all the instances of
the type are specified when the class is defined.  For example:
</p><pre>public enum Days { Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun; }
</pre>
creates a non-primitive type <tt>Days</tt> and 7 instances of the type.  The <tt>Mon</tt>, etc., are each <tt>public static final</tt>
 variables that store one of the 7 instances of the type.
Just like with other non-primitive types, you can create methods, 
constructors, etc., by placing them inside the curly braces and after 
the listed variables. 
Because no new instances can be created, the constructor for the enum 
type cannot be public.  If you create a constructor that takes input, 
you pass the input to the constructor by putting parentheses after
each of the enum instance variables.  For example: <tt>Mon(1), Tue(2), ...</tt>.<p></p>

<h4>An overview of variable length parameters</h4>

<p>A variable length parameter is a Java shortcut that can be used by a 
method that takes an array as input.  With the shortcut, you do not need
 to create the array explicitly.
For example:
</p><pre>public int maximum(int[] a) { 
  int max = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i &lt; a.length; i++)
    if (a[i] &gt; a[max])
      max = i;
  return max;
}
</pre>
is the normal way we pass an array to a method.  To call <tt>maximum</tt>, we must create an array first:  <tt>maximum(new int[]{1, 2, 3})</tt>.<p></p>
<p>If we change <tt>maximum</tt> to take a <em>variable length parameter</em>, it looks like this:
</p><pre>public int maximum(int... a) { 
  int max = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i &lt; a.length; i++)
    if (a[i] &gt; a[max])
      max = i;
  return max;
}
</pre>
Notice that the body of <tt>maximum</tt> did not change.  The input <tt>a</tt> is still an array of <tt>int</tt>.  However, we now have two ways to call <tt>a</tt>.  We can still use the traditional way of 
passing in an array: <tt>maximum(new int[]{1, 2, 3})</tt> or we can just pass in the elements and Java will automatically place them in an array of the correct size: <tt>maximum(1, 2, 3)</tt>.
Note that there can be only one <em>variable length parameter</em> per method, and the <em>variable length parameter</em> must be the last parameter of the method.  (Can you see why?)<p></p>

<h4>Your programming task</h4>

<p>Some programming languages, like Scratch, are designed for beginning 
programmers, and especially children, to learn the basics of coding.  In
 these languages,
coding structures are often displayed graphically as colored blocks and 
shaped in a way to indicate what types of structures can be contained in
 other structures.
The purpose of this code is to design the underlying model used for a 
simple Scratch-like programming language.  You will design classes that 
represent different programming
language strucrures, and then a user can program by combining the 
different structures together.</p>

<p>Your project should contain the following types.  Each type can be a 
class or an interface.  You may need to create additional types to 
accomplish all the tasks.  The goal is to write a good hierachy that 
limits the amount of code you need to write:
</p><ol>
<li><p><tt>State</tt>:  The state represents the variables and their contents that are accessible to a particular part of the program. 
Because our language is geared to true novices, the only type we will allow is <tt>int</tt>.  Since everything is an <tt>int</tt>, we will
not have errors if a variable is used before it is assigned a value.</p>
<p>The <tt>State</tt> should contain a <tt>Hashtable</tt> from the Java API.  You should set the key of the hashtable to be <tt>String</tt> (this will represent the names of the
variables) and the values of the hashtable to be type <tt>int</tt> (this will represent the values stored in the variables.  The <tt>State</tt> class should have the following
methods:
</p><ul><li><tt>update</tt> takes a <em>variable name</em> and a <em>variable value</em>.  The name and value pair should be added to the hash table.</li>
<li><tt>lookup</tt> takes a <em>variable name</em> and returns the <tt>int</tt> value of the variable, as stored in the hashtable.  If there is no such variable in the hashtable,
the value returned should be 0. (No error should be given because we want to avoid all errors in our language.)</li>
</ul><p></p>
</li>

<li><p><tt>Variable</tt>: The <tt>Variable</tt> type represents a variable in our program.  A <tt>Variable</tt> type instance should be created with one argument: a string name, and the type should
have the following methods:
</p><ul><li><tt>value</tt>: takes a <em>state</em> as input and returns the <tt>int</tt> value associated with this variable name that is stored in the input state.</li>
    <li><tt>toString</tt>: should return the name of the variable.</li>
</ul><p></p></li>


<li><p><tt>Number</tt>: The <tt>Number</tt> type represents a whole number.  A <tt>Number</tt> type instance should be created with one argument: an <tt>int</tt> value, and the type should have the

</p><pre>public enum Operator { Add, Sub, Mult, Div, Rem; }
</pre>
The operators represent the +, -, *, /, and % operations.<p></p>
<p>
An <tt>ArithmeticOperation</tt> type instance should be created with three arguments: 
an <em>operation</em> that is from the above <tt>Operator</tt> enum type, and two <em>expressions</em>
that represent the left operand expression and the right operand 
expression.  The type should allow any language structure that has an <tt>int</tt> value to be a possible
expression.   The <tt>ArithmeticOperation</tt> type should have the following methods:
</p><ul><li><tt>value</tt>: takes a <em>state</em> as input and returns the <tt>int</tt> value that is the result of applying the <em>operation</em> to the values of each of the operand
<em>expressions</em>.  The <em>state</em> should be used to get the values of the <em>expressions</em>.</li>
    <li><tt>toString</tt>: should return a string that first contains a 
string representation of the left operand followed by a space, a string 
representation of the operator, 
a space, and the string representation of the right operand.</li>
    </ul>
<p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>Comparison</tt>: The <tt>Comparison</tt> type represents a comparison between two <em>expressions</em>.  The <tt>Comparison</tt> type should contain the following
enum type to represent the possible comparisons for the langauge (you are free to add additional operators if you wish):

</pre>
The operators represent the &lt; &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, ==, and != operations.<p></p>
<p>The <tt>Comparison</tt> type instance should be created with three arguments: an <em>operation</em> that is from the above <tt>Operator</tt> enum type, and two
<em>expressions</em> that represent the left operand expression and the 
right operand expression.  The type should allow any language structure 
that has an <tt>int</tt> value to be
a possible expression.  The <tt>Comparison</tt> type should have the following methods:
</p><ul><li><tt>value</tt>: takes a <em>state</em> as input and returns the <tt>boolean</tt> value that is the result of applying the <em>operation</em> to the values of each of the
operand <em>expressions</em>.  The <em>state</em> should be used to get the values of the <em>expressions</em>.</li>
    <li><tt>toString</tt>: should return a string that first contains a 
string representation of the left operand followed by a space, a string 
representation of the operator, 
a space, and the string representation of the right operand.</li>
   </ul>
<p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>BooleanOperation</tt>: The <tt>BooleanOperation</tt> type represents a boolean operation between two boolean conditions.
The <tt>BooleanOperation</tt> type should
contain the following enum type to represent the possible operations for
 the language (you are free to add additional operators if you wish):
</p><pre>public enum Operator { And, Or; }
</pre>
The operators represent the &amp;&amp; and || operations.<p></p>
<p>
An <tt>BooleanOperation</tt> type instance should be created with three arguments: 
an <em>operation</em> that is from the above <tt>Operator</tt> enum type, and two <em>boolean conditions</em>
that represent the left operand and the right operand.  The type should allow any language structure that has a <tt>boolean</tt> value to be a possible
condition.   The <tt>BooleanOperation</tt> type should have the following methods:
</p><ul><li><tt>value</tt>: takes a <em>state</em> as input and returns the <tt>boolean</tt> value that is the result of applying the <em>operation</em> to the values of each of the operand
<em>conditions</em>.  The <em>state</em> should be used to get the values of the <em>conditions</em>.</li>
    <li><tt>toString</tt>: should return a string that first contains a 
string representation of the left operand followed by a space, a string 
representation of the operator, 
a space, and the string representation of the right operand.</li>
    </ul>

<li><p><tt>Assignment</tt>: The <tt>Assignment</tt> type represents an assignment statement in the language.
An <tt>Assignment</tt> type instance should be created with two arguments, a <em>variable</em> and an <em>expression</em>.  Any language structure that has an <tt>int</tt> value
should be allowed as the <em>expression</em>.   The <tt>Assignment</tt> type should have the following methods:
</p><ul><li><tt>execute</tt>: takes a <em>state</em> and returns nothing.  The method <em>updates</em> the <em>state</em> to set the value of the <em>variable</em> to be the <em>value</em>
of the <em>expression</em>. The <em>state</em> should be used to get the value of the <em>expression</em>.</li>
    <li><tt>toString</tt>: should return a string that contains the <em>variable</em>'s string value, followed by a space, followed by ":=" character, followed by a space,
           followed by a string representation of the <em>expression</em> followed by a semicolon, followed by the newline character.</li>
    <li><tt>toStringTabbed</tt>: takes an <tt>int</tt> as input and returns a string.  The returned string should be indentical to what is returned by <tt>toString</tt> except that
            the string is prefixed by a number of tab characters equal to the value of the input <tt>int</tt>.  You may assume the input value is not negative.</li>
    </ul>
<p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>Return</tt>: The <tt>Return</tt> type represents a return statement in the language.
A <tt>Return</tt> type instance should be created with one argument, an <em>expression</em>.  Any language structure that has an <tt>int</tt> value should be allowed as the <em>expression</em>. 
  The <tt>Return</tt> type should have the following methods:
</p><ul><li><tt>execute</tt>: takes a <em>state</em> and returns nothing.  The method <em>updates</em> the <em>state</em> to set the value of a special variable called <em>"return"</em>

    </ul>
<p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>ConditionalStatement</tt>: The <tt>ConditionalStatement</tt> type represents a conditional statement (if) in the language.
A <tt>ConditionalStatement</tt> type instance should be created with three arguments, a <em>boolean condition</em> and two <em>statements</em> representing the then statement and

should be allowed as either statement. 
  The <tt>ConditionalStatement</tt> type should have the following methods:
</p><ul><li><tt>execute</tt>: takes a <em>state</em> and returns nothing.  The <em>state</em> is used to get the value of the <em>condition</em>.  If the condition's <em>value</em> is
<tt>true</tt> the <em>state</em> is used to executed the then <em>statement</em>.  Otherwise the <em>state</em> is used to execute the the else <em>statement</em>.</li>

 "if", followed by a space, followed by a "(", followed by the string 
representation of the conditional,
           followed by a ")", followed by a newline character, followed

should be allowed as the body. 
  The <tt>Loop</tt> type should have the following methods:
</p><ul><li><tt>execute</tt>: takes a <em>state</em> and returns nothing.  The method has a loop.  At each iteration of the loop, the <em>state</em> is used to get the

    </ul>
<p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>CompoundStatement</tt>: The <tt>CompoundStatement</tt> type represents a compound statement/block of code in the language.
A <tt>CompoundStatement</tt> type instance should be created with one <em>variable length parameter</em> of <em>statements</em>.
Any language structure that represents a statement should be allowed as the body. 
The <tt>CompoundStatement</tt> type should have the following methods:
</p><ul><li><tt>execute</tt>: takes a <em>state</em> and returns nothing.  The method has a loop.  At each iteration of the loop, the <em>state</em> is used to execute each 
          of the <em>statements</em> in the array of <em>statements</em>, in order.</li>
    <li><tt>toString</tt>: should return a string that contains a text "{", followed by a newline character, followed by the result of calling the <tt>toStringTabbed</tt> method

    <li><tt>toStringTabbed</tt>: takes an <tt>int</tt> as input and returns a string.  The returned string should be indentical to what is returned by <tt>toString</tt> except that
            the "}" and "{" are prefixed by a number of tab characters equal to <em>one less</em> than the value of the input <tt>int</tt>, and the <tt>toStringTabbed</tt> method for each
            <em>statement</em> in the list is called with an input that is equal to the input to this method.  You may assume the input value is not negative.</li>
    </ul>
<p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>Function</tt>: The <tt>Function</tt> type represents a function definition in the language.
A <tt>Function</tt> type instance should be created with three inputs: a string name, a <em>statement</em> that is the function body, and a <em>variable length parameter</em> of <em>variables</em> that will be this function's parameters.
Any language structure that represents a statement should be allowed as the body. 
The <tt>Function</tt> type should have the following method:
</p><ul>
    <li><tt>toString</tt>: should return a string that contains a text 
"function", followed by the function's name, followed by "(", followed 
by each of the
           <em>variables</em> of the function, separated by a space and a comma (except the last one), followed by a ")", followed by the newline character,
           followed by the result of calling the <tt>toStringTabbed</tt> method of the body of the function with input 1.</li>
    </ul>
<p></p></li>

<li><p><tt>FunctionCall</tt>: The <tt>FunctionCall</tt> type represents a function call in the language.
A <tt>FunctionCall</tt> type instance should be created with two inputs: a <tt>Function</tt> and a <em>variable length parameter</em> of <em>expressions</em> that will
be the arguments of this function call.
Any language structure that produces an <tt>int</tt> value should be allowed as an expression. 
The <tt>FunctionCall</tt> type should have the following methods:
</p><ul>
    <li><tt>value</tt>: should take a <em>state</em> and return an <tt>int</tt>.  The method should create a new empty <em>state</em>.  For each <em>variable</em>
        in the function's list of parameters, the new <em>state</em> should be <em>updated</em> with this <em>variable</em> and the value from the corresponding
        argument.  The original <em>state</em> should be used to get the value of the argument.  If there is no corresponding argument, the value of 0 should be
        used for the <em>update</em>.  Then, the function's body should be executed using the new <em>state</em>.  Finally, the value of the keyword <tt>"return"</tt>
        should be <em>looked up</em> in the new <em>state</em> and returned from this function.</li>
        
    <li><tt>toString</tt>: should return a string that contains the 
function's name, followed by "(", followed by the string representation 
of each of the
           arguments of the function call, separated by a space and a 
comma (except the last one), followed by a ")".</li>
    </ul>
<p></p></li>

</ol>
<p></p>

<h4>An example</h4>

<p>If you get the above classes working, you can do the following:
</p><pre>&gt; Variable x = new Variable("x")
&gt; Variable n = new Variable("n")
&gt; Function f = new Function("sum", new CompoundStatement(new Assignment(x, new Number(0)), new Loop(new Comparison(Comparison.Operator.GT, n, new Number(0)), new CompoundStatement(new Assignment(x, new ArithmeticOperation(ArithmeticOperation.Operator.Add, x, n)), new Assignment(n, new ArithmeticOperation(ArithmeticOperation.Operator.Sub, n, new Number(1))))), new Return(x)), n)
&gt; f.toString()
"function sum(n)
{
	x := 0;
	while (n &gt; 0)
	{
		x := x + n;
		n := n - 1;
	}
	return x;
}"

&gt; new FunctionCall(f, new Number(1)).value(new State())
1
&gt; new FunctionCall(f, new Number(10)).value(new State())
55
&gt; Function m = new Function("main", new CompoundStatement(new Assignment(new Variable("y"), new Number(6)), new Return(new FunctionCall(f, new Variable("y")))))
&gt; m.toString()
"function main()
{
	y := 6;
	return sum(y);
}"

&gt; new FunctionCall(m).value(new State())

</pre><p></p>


<h3>JUnit Testing (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>You are to write JUnit tests for your classes as well as a testing report.  The testing report should describe the <em>kinds</em>
 of tests that are required
for this project.  The JUnit testing classes should have comments and 
testing method names matching the specific tests to the descriptions in 
your report.</p>
